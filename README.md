# UNO Game but designed in Python : A simple, text-based 2-player UNO game built using Python. 

FEATURES INCLUDE:

- 🔄 Reverse, ⏭️ Skip, ➕2 Draw Two, ➕4 Wild Draw Four
- 🌈 Wild cards with color choice
- 🤝 2 human players taking alternate turns
- 🎲 Shuffled deck and proper card dealing
- ✋ Automatic handling of invalid moves, drawing cards, and game-winning condition

HOW TO RUN?

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python uno.py

Further, I plan on developing it 
- Into a better UX/UI.
- Both players can't see each other's cards and play on independent platforms.
